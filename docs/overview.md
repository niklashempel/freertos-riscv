# Overview

FreeRTOS is a class of RTOS that is designed to be small enough to run on a microcontroller - although its use is not limited to microcontroller applications. \[...\] The size constraints, and dedicated end application nature, rarely warrant the use of a full RTOS implementation - or indeed make the use of a full RTOS implementation possible. FreeRTOS therefore provides the core real time scheduling functionality, inter-task communication, timing and synchronisation primitives only.
